# robust-tensor-principal-component-analysis

The matlab codes are for some recent advanced on robust tensor principal component analysis methods.

- The file "core_matrix_TRPCA" is for the experiments in the paper using improved robust tensor PCA [1]. 

- The file "block_TRPCA" is for the experiments in the paper using robust block tensor PCA [2].

- The "frequency_filtered_TRPCA" is for the experiments in the paper using frequency-filter tensor PCA [3].

- The codes for the experiments using Smooth Robust Tensor Principal Component Analysis [4], can be availabe at:
